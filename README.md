I'm excited to share the findings from the Level 1 phase of our restaurant data analysis project. This stage focused on data exploration, preprocessing, and descriptive analysis, setting the groundwork for deeper insights. Here’s a summary of what we discovered:

🔍 Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Dataset Overview: Analyzed a dataset with 9551 rows and 21 columns, covering key restaurant attributes like location, customer experience, and financial indicators.
Missing Values: Addressed missing values in the "Cuisines" column by labeling them as "Unknown" to maintain data integrity.
Data Types: Verified and confirmed the appropriateness of data types for all variables.
Target Variable: Identified a significant class imbalance in the "Aggregate Rating," indicating challenges for future modeling.
📈 Descriptive Analysis: Numerical Insights: Revealed diverse pricing and vote distributions, highlighting market dynamics and customer engagement trends. Categorical Trends: Showed strong preferences for North Indian, Chinese, and Italian cuisines, and identified urban concentration in restaurant locations.

🌍 Geospatial Analysis: Heatmap Visualization: Mapped restaurant ratings geographically, revealing urban clusters and varying rating patterns. Key Findings: Most restaurants receive average ratings between 3.0 and 4.0, with few achieving exceptional ratings above 4.5. Notable number of restaurants have a rating of 0.0, pointing to areas for further investigation. This foundational analysis has paved the way for more in-depth investigation in subsequent stages.
